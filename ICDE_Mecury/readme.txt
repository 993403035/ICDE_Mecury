Our source code implements Mercury's transaction allocation logic and reproduces the transaction allocation logic of CLPA, PLouvain, Txallo, ShardScheduler, LB-Chain, Monoxide, and Metis. Additionally, we simplified and modified the transaction allocation logic of the BlockEmulator platform, setting the number of shards to 12. Reviewers and readers can quickly run simulation experiments (approximately 3 minutes) on low-specification Windows machines to compare Mercuryâ€™s performance against various other schemes.
